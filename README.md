# Tasks

## Create a project to parse the Quake log file.

branch: `main` - Link: [main](https://github.com/JuniorTrojilio/quake-III-log-parser)

The log file was generated by a Quake 3 Arena server, including a great deal of information of every match.
The project should implement the following functionalities:

- [x] Read the log file. `The log file was provided in the repository as "log.txt"`
- [x] Group the game data of each match. `The game data was grouped by the match number like "game_1", "game_2", etc... according to the example`
- [x] Collect the kill data

### Example proposed:

```JSON
{
  "game_1": {
    "total_kills": 45,
    "players": ["Dono da bola", "Isgalamido", "Zeh"],
    "kills": {
      "Dono da bola": 5,
      "Isgalamido": 18,
      "Zeh": 20
    }
  }
}
```

### Solution provided

```JSON
{
    "game_20": {
      "total_kills": 3,
      "players": [
        "Isgalamido",
        "Oootsimo",
        "Dono da Bola",
        "Assasinu Credi",
        "Zeh",
        "Mal"
      ],
      "kills": {
        "Dono da Bola": 2,
        "Zeh": 0,
        "Oootsimo": 1,
        "Assasinu Credi": 0
      },
    }
  }
```

### Followed rules

- When <world> kill a player, that player loses -1 kill score.
- Since <world> is not a player, it should not appear in the list of players or in the dictionary of kills.
- The counter total_kills includes player and world deaths.

# Report

branch: `feat/ranking`

- [x] - Create a script that prints a report (grouped information) for each match and a player ranking. `Sample not provided`

### Solution provided

```JSON
{
  "game_1": {
    "total_kills": 45,
    "players": ["Dono da bola", "Isgalamido", "Zeh"],
    "kills": {
      "Dono da bola": 5,
      "Isgalamido": 18,
      "Zeh": 20
    },
    "ranking": [
        { "player": "Dono da Bola", "kills": 2, "position": 1 },
        { "player": "Oootsimo", "kills": 1, "position": 2 },
        { "player": "Zeh", "kills": 0, "position": 3 },
        { "player": "Assasinu Credi", "kills": 0, "position": 4 }
      ]
  }
}
```

`Tiebreaker: Has no tiebreaker implemented, the ranking is based on the order of the players kill in the log file. Could be implemented a system based on KDA or other criteria.`

# Plus

branch: `feat/report-by-death`

- [x] Generate a report of deaths grouped by death cause for each match.

### Example proposed

```JSON
{
  "game-1": {
  "kills_by_means": {
    "MOD_SHOTGUN": 10,
    "MOD_RAILGUN": 2,
    "MOD_GAUNTLET": 1,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Solution provided

```JSON
{
    "game_19": {
      "total_kills": 95,
      "players": [
        "Isgalamido",
        "Oootsimo",
        "Dono da Bola",
        "Assasinu Credi",
        "Zeh",
        "Mal"
      ],
      "kills": {
        "Mal": 2,
        "Zeh": 20,
        "Dono da Bola": 14,
        "Isgalamido": 14,
        "Assasinu Credi": 9,
        "Oootsimo": 10
      },
      "kills_by_means": {
        "MOD_ROCKET": 27,
        "MOD_ROCKET_SPLASH": 32,
        "MOD_SHOTGUN": 6,
        "MOD_RAILGUN": 10,
        "MOD_MACHINEGUN": 7
      }
    }
  }
```

# Extra mile

branch: `feat/events`

- [x] Some game rounds are not finished on log file (`like round 2` - Has `InitGame` log but not `ShutdownGame`), to observe this behavior, the script implements a simple event system to notify based on log file, when a game round is unexpectedly finished.

```JSON
{
  {
    "game_2": {
      "total_kills": 11,
      "players": [ "Isgalamido", "Dono da Bola", "Mocinha" ],
      "kills": { "Isgalamido": -5, "Mocinha": 0 },
      "events": [ "successfully_started", "unexpected_close" ]
    }
  },
  {
    "game_3": {
      "total_kills": 4,
      "players": [ "Dono da Bola", "Mocinha", "Isgalamido", "Zeh" ],
      "kills": { "Isgalamido": 1, "Mocinha": 0, "Zeh": -2, "Dono da Bola": -1 },
      "events": [ "successfully_started", "successfully_finished" ]
    }
  },
}
```
