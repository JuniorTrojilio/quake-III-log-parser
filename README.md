## Problem

# Tasks

## 1

Create a project to parse the Quake log file.
The log file was generated by a Quake 3 Arena server, including a great deal of information of every match.
The project should implement the following functionalities:

- [x] Read the log file. `The log file was provided in the repository as "log.txt"`
- [x] Group the game data of each match. `The game data was grouped by the match number like "game_1", "game_2", etc... according to the example`
- [x] Collect the kill data

### Example proposed:

```JSON
{
  "game_1": {
    "total_kills": 45,
    "players": ["Dono da bola", "Isgalamido", "Zeh"],
    "kills": {
      "Dono da bola": 5,
      "Isgalamido": 18,
      "Zeh": 20
    }
  }
}
```

### Solution provided

```JSON
{
    "game_20": {
      "total_kills": 3,
      "players": [
        "Isgalamido",
        "Oootsimo",
        "Dono da Bola",
        "Assasinu Credi",
        "Zeh",
        "Mal"
      ],
      "kills": {
        "Dono da Bola": 2,
        "Zeh": 0,
        "Oootsimo": 1,
        "Assasinu Credi": 0
      },
    }
  }
```

### Followed rules

- When <world> kill a player, that player loses -1 kill score.
- Since <world> is not a player, it should not appear in the list of players or in the dictionary of kills.
- The counter total_kills includes player and world deaths.

# Report

- [x] - Create a script that prints a report (grouped information) for each match and a player ranking. `Sample not provided`

### Solution provided

```JSON
{
  "game_1": {
    "total_kills": 45,
    "players": ["Dono da bola", "Isgalamido", "Zeh"],
    "kills": {
      "Dono da bola": 5,
      "Isgalamido": 18,
      "Zeh": 20
    },
    "ranking": [
        { "player": "Dono da Bola", "kills": 2, "position": 1 },
        { "player": "Oootsimo", "kills": 1, "position": 2 },
        { "player": "Zeh", "kills": 0, "position": 3 },
        { "player": "Assasinu Credi", "kills": 0, "position": 4 }
      ]
  }
}
```

`Tiebreaker: Has no tiebreaker implemented, the ranking is based on the order of the players kill in the log file. Could be implemented a system based on KDA or other criteria.`

# Plus

- [x] Generate a report of deaths grouped by death cause for each match.
